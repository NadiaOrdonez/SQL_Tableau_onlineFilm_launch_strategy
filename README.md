# SQL_onlineFilm_launch_strategy
This repository serves as a demonstration of the refined SQL syntax applied combined with visuals crafted in Tableau in the context of our comprehensive data analysis project. The analysis presented herein is instrumental in assisting Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a prominent film company, as it formulates a strategic plan for the successful launch of an online video service. 
## Project Overview
### Motivation
In response to fierce competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster Stealth is leveraging its extensive film licenses to launch a cutting-edge online video rental service.
### Objective
Address business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board, guiding the 2020 company strategy. This includes customer demographics, highest revenue films, and sales figures.
#### Business questions 
1. Which films contributed the most/least to sales?
2. What was the average rental duration for all films?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
### Scope
The data-driven insights on customer behavior and sales trends are extracted from the current company database and will aid in shaping the 2020 launch strategy for an online service.
## Database overview
The entity relationship diagram (ERD) for our company database was constructed using DbVisualiser [see ERD](ERD_database_NadiaOrdonez.png). This illustrates the links between the tables in our relational database. For a detailed description of the tables and how they are linked please refer to the [data dictionary](Data_dictionary_NadiaOrdonez.pdf)

## Visualizations
After executing SQL queries, we utilized Tableau to create compelling visualizations that not only illustrate our findings but also provide robust support for the recommendations outlined in our launch strategy.

## Main recommendations
2020 Launch strategy recommendations supported by our data analysis:
* Stop film licenses for films with none and low sales and instead invest in:
  * High-selling films:
    * Top 3 categories: Drama, New, Games
    * Top rating: PG-13
    * Top 3 actors: Gina Degeneres, Matthew Carrey, and Mary Kaitel
  * Consider including more thrillers to offer a well-balanced mix of categories.
* The Asia market has high customer engagement and sales, making it a prime candidate for a pilot online video rental service launch.
* Analyze customer film views at the country/customer level to satisfy their preferences.
* Explore how the popularity of certain types of content (categories, ratings, actors, etc.) changes over time after our launch strategy to align our film content acquisition strategy accordingly.
* Analyze the strategies and content offerings of competitors in the online video rental space to identify potential tactics that attract new customers.
